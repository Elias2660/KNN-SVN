# KNN-SVN Project

This project explores the implementation and comparison of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms using Python and scikit-learn.

## Project Structure

- `K_Neighbors/`
    - `neighbors_vs_accuracy.py`: This script evaluates the accuracy of the KNN model with different numbers of neighbors on the breast cancer dataset. It plots the relationship between the number of neighbors and the accuracy of the model.

- `SVMs/`
    - `intro_to_svms.py`: This script will introduce the basics of SVMs and their implementation using scikit-learn.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KNN-SVN.git
     ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd KNN-SVN
     ```
3. Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage

### K-Nearest Neighbors

To run the KNN script and visualize the accuracy:
```bash
python K_Neighbors/neighbors_vs_accuracy.py
```

### Support Vector Machines

To run the SVM script:
```bash
python SVMs/intro_to_svms.py
```
